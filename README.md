We utilized Gaussian Splatting technology and incorporated it within Unity to observe how functional it would be for game design and simulations at its current point in development.

In order to access our projects, you will have to manually add the models yourself (this is due to the large size of the models). The models are located here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Us0jvAraGV4h1BOv_A9UR_-ewKYnGQc9?usp=sharing

Place the following models into this address: GaussianSplatting-NeRF-Showcase/projects/GaussianExample/Assets/GaussianAssets.
You may need to reslot the models in the GaussianSplats Object within each scene in order to see correct results. 
Afterwards, open up the Menu Scene and start the project. You can move around with WASD or the Arrow Keys, and Jump with Space. In order to progress to the next scene, press "E". 

Writeup for this project is located here: https://cal-cs184-student.github.io/hw-webpages-sp24-Miratari/final-report/index.html
